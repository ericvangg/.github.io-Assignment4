# How to reproduce my portfolio


Step 1: Get a template you like, I personally got mine from bootstrap this one specifically https://startbootstrap.com/theme/stylish-portfolio


Step 2: Edit your index.html page to your liking and edit the css pages to make sure everything flows together


Step 3: For your video I choose to use <muted, loop and autoplay> to have my video muted and automatically play when the page loads up while having it loop after it ends.


Step 4: For the subscribe part, I use a button that links to the thankyou.html page which uses a script from https://github.com/mathusummut/confetti.js/ , this plays confetti when the page loads up
