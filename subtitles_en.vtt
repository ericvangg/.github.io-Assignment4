00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.606
I am going to show you how i made my portfolio.

2
00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:14.000
I used a template from this site called bootstrap.

3
00:00:14.00 --> 00:00:20.00
When you subscribe confetti it will take you to another webpage that has confetti

4
00:00:20.00 --> 00:00:30.00
Using the template called stylish portfolio it makes life very easy

5
00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:40.00
I use visual studio code as my text editor

6
00:00:40.00 --> 00:01:00.00
Downloading this template already comes with everything you need, all you have to do is edit the index.html and css page


7
00:01:00.00 --> 00:01:10.00
Using visual studio code as my text editor I linked the subscribe button to the thankyou.html page

8
00:01:10.00 --> 00:01:20.00
Using a script from mathusummut. Placing it into the body allowed the confetti to display.

9
00:01:40.00 --> 00:01:50.00
Autoplay makes it so that the video automatically plays when the page loads

10
00:01:50.00 --> 00:02:00.00
Loop allows for my video to constantly loop even after it finishes

11
00:02:15.00 --> 00:02:29.00
Simple and easy to do but this is how i made my portfolio!
